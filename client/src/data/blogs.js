    story: `
Bora Bora is the kind of place you see on postcards and assume must be exaggerated — until you’re standing in it.

I arrived just after sunrise, when the horizon was painted in soft gold and pink. The air felt warm and salty, and the moment I stepped off the boat, I understood why people call this the “Jewel of the Pacific.” The water wasn’t just blue — it was a glowing gradient of turquoise that looked almost unreal.

My evenings were quiet. I’d sit outside my bungalow, feet dangling above the water, watching the sky turn purple. The island felt peaceful, safe, and dreamlike, as if time didn’t matter there.

Bora Bora didn’t give me an adrenaline rush. It gave me something better: stillness, awe, and a story I’ll carry forever.

with only three houses on it. A fisherman named Teva grilled fresh mahi-mahi 
and shared stories about the island. The tranquility and simplicity were breathtaking.
